The chat app uses the Socket.IO library so that users can join a room and chat with individuals in that specific room. Current features in place include: join a room, sending messages in that room, and sending geolocation information. As users enter and leave the room, the room list updates and an admin message announces the change.

# How to use
- First, navigate to Chat App.
- Next, you are prompted to enter a name and chat room.
- Finally, share this link with friends!
- Once you join the same chat room you can communicate with others in real-time or choose to share your location.
